# Rock-paper-scissors

Video Demo:

Description:

Let me introduce my final project of CS50.

I made a well-known game Rock-Scissors-Paper.  In this game each player should select one of the gesture (it can be rock, scissors or  paper) and show there choise at the same time. You should remember that Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper and Paper is stronger than Rock.


In my program user plays with a computer.
You should have a webcam to use this program.
Use 's' key to start game or new round. 
For the correct recognize of user`s choise he should show in to the webcam next gesture:

 rock - clenched fist;
 paper - open palm;
 scissors - victory sign like V.
  
The program uses OpenCV libraries due to what it recognizes your hands gesture. 

The program doesn`t cheat, doesn`t has delay betwen yours choise and PC`s one. Program`s choise of gesture is based on random function.
